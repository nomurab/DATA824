# DATA824
DATA824 Final Project - Shiny App

This Final Project objective was to create a Shiny App using R, to explore a variety of different data representations.
-The shiny app takes the provided "Tornado.data" csv file as input, and is able to produce a variety of interactive charts and graphs.
1) Map - displays tornado reports and tornado magnitude based on storm starting latitude and longitude.
2) Trends - displays the total count of tornado reports by year.
3) State Impact - displays the total number of fatalities and injuries by State.
4) Magnitude Distribution - displays total count for each tornado magnitude by State.

By using the shiny app, one can determine what data found in the data set is worth using for additional analysis.
It can also be used, visually, to try and determine correlations between various variables.
